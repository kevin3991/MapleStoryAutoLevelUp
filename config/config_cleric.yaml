# 🎯 KEY BINDINGS
# Match these to your in-game keys. Uncomment once you're done.
key:

  teleport: "a"             # 🌀 Leave empty ("") if your class can’t teleport.
  jump: "z"             # 🦘 Set to jump. No need to change unless you use a non-standard key.
  add_hp: "1"               # ❤️ Assign to HP potion hotkey. Match with your potion shortcut.
  add_mp: "2"               # 💧 Assign to MP potion hotkey. Match with your potion shortcut.

# 🧙‍♂️ Edge Teleport

# When your character approaches the edge of a platform,
# this feature triggers a teleport (for Mages) to prevent falling.

# 🧙 BUFF SKILLS
# Add keys for buffs you want to auto-cast. Match cooldowns with actual in-game durations.

  cooldown: [122, 70, 50, 80]       # ⏱️ Set each skill’s cooldown (seconds). Be precise to avoid spamming.

# ⚔️ DIRECTIONAL ATTACK SETTINGS
# Tune these by observing the debug window.
# Smaller range -> you will fight monster in close-range combat
# Larger range -> you will attack monster far away, but could hit nothing if it's set to large
directional_attack:
  range_x: 320              # ↔️ Try reducing if you’re hitting unreachable monsters.
  range_y: 90               # ↕️

# 💥 AOE SKILL SETTINGS
# Similar to directional attack. Adjust to match your AoE hitbox on screen.
aoe_skill:
  # Multiple heal
  # range_x: 350               # ↔️ Try reducing if you’re hitting unreachable monsters.
  # range_y: 170               # ↕️

# ❤️ HEALTH MONITOR
# Use this to auto-drink potions at specific HP/MP thresholds.
# Cleric use skill to heal; therefore, need to set force_heal to False
health_monitor:
